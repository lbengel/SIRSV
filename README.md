# SIRSV
Code used for the numerical experiments in my master's thesis "A mean field game to study contact behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic".

The file "SIRSV.py" contains an implementaion of a fixpoint iteration method to compute the Mean-Fiel-Nash equilibrium and a Forward-Backward Sweep method to approximate the societal optimum in the case of the general SIRSV-model.
